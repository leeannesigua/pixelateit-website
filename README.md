# pixelateit-website
I created this website as a course project for my web development class as well as for a friend in the hopes that she will use it in the future. This website is about my friend and her perler bead creations.

This website is created with HTML and CSS.
It consists of:

index.html - The homepage of the website.

gallery.html - This page has two categories that will link to either the keychainGallery.html page or the 3x3Gallery.html page.

keychainGallery.html - This page is a gallery that show small perler bead creations that can be put on keychains.

3x3Gallery.html - This page is a gallery that show 3x3 sized perler bead creations that can be used as gifts or decorations.

about.html - This is the about page which has a description about my friend as well as how she started pixelateit.

contact.html - The contact page is used for the visitors to get in touch with my friend through the use of a contact form where visitors can leave a messege. 

  -The contact page does not officially work since my friend is not going to publish the site anytime soon. For now, if you enter any information within the contact form and click submit, there will be a page that will show the information that you have entered.

pixelateit.css - contains all CSS for pixelateit website.
