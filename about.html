    <p>I started perler beading as side project just for fun. Over time it became my hobby. I've been doing perler beading for three years now. During that time, I've sold over 100 designs on etsy. But due to my busy schedule, I no longer have an etsy account. <br><br>
    
        For those that don't know what perler beading is. It is when you take beads and create a design on a peg board. Then you melt the beads using ironing paper and an iron. The beads used to make the designs are called perler beads and can melt when you iron them.<br><br>
    
        I created Pixelateit because I still enjoy making designs for people. If you would like me to create a design for you feel free to contact me.
